        <div class="contenu">
        <p>The climbing hall market and the sale of climbing equipment 	 is experiencing a significant dynamic, driven by a steady increase in the number of practitioners.<br>
            In 2024, there are more than 2 million climbers in France, of which 84% say they<br>
            Once a week or more in clubs or via private room offers.</p>

        <h2 class="titre">2.Profil des pratiquants</h2>

        <img src="../img/photo.jpg" width="367" height="222" >


        <p>

            The majority of climbers are aged between 12 and 25 years old,<br>
            a growing age group.<br>
            Growth is particularly marked among women, who are<br>
           now represent 42% of practitioners and 58% of new practitioners, making climbing an almost equal activity.</p>


        <h2 class="titre">3.Market size and dynamics</h2>

        <img src="../img/money.jpg" width="561" height="262">

        <p>
            According to Union Sport & Cycle:<br>
            In addition, the climbing market in France is experiencing significant growth.<br>
             With a turnover of 150 million euros only for climbing halls<br>
            and 500 million including all the equipment dedicated to verticality.”<br>
            With about 200 climbing halls throughout the Hexagon,<br>
            of the 8,000 sports venues in the territory.”<br>
            by Virgile Caillet, Union Sport & Cycle Delegate General.</p>


        <h2 class="titre">4.Influence of the Olympic Games and media</h2>

            <p>The momentum of the Olympic Games continued to build youth interest in the sport.<br>
                In September, attendance increased by 17%.<br>
                This increase is particularly visible among young people aged 12 to 17,<br>
                and is explained in particular by the success of Inoxtag’s documentary "Kaizen".</p>

        <h2 class="titre">5.Geographical distribution of rooms</h2>


        <img src="../img/map.png">

        <p>
            The concentration of climbing halls varies by region:<br>
            <br>• 91 rooms in Île-de-France.•<br> 63 rooms between Lyon, Grenoble and Valence.<br>
           The offer is limited. In Lille, for example, there are only 2 climbing halls.</p>


        <h2 class="titre">6.Competition in the market</h2>

        <img class="concurrence" src="../img/concurrence.jpg" widht="381" height="231">

        <p>
            Many climbing sites are located in the Île-de-France,<br>
            in the mountains, and between Valence, Lyon and Grenoble.<br>
            But the competition remains very low in the North with only 2 rooms in Lille,<br>
            This makes for greater attractiveness.</p>

        <p>Climb Up is the market leader in climbing.<br>
            He has outperformed his competitors by offering a family experience<br>
            We pay particular attention to the quality of openings,<br>
            by providing in-house support and training.”<br>
            It also draws its strength from the fame of its founder François Petit,<br>
            Multiple world champion, former coach of the national climbing team.<br>
            Climb Up benefits from the experience of old</p>


        <img src="../img/climbup.jpg" width="811" height="517">

        <p>High level climbers, world champions, international openers<br>
            Finally, it offers living and wellness spaces:<br>
            Beyond climbing, our rooms offer living or coworking cozy spaces,<br>
            a bar-restaurant service, a training and stretching area...<br>
            But also wellness areas (sauna, hammam, yoga...).»</p>

        <p>Climb Up is one of two companies based in Lille. The second and biggest competitor is Arkose.<br>
            Arkose is much more environmentally responsible by using eco-friendly materials.<br>
            He focuses his activity on the block, but Climb Up diversifies by offering ropes.<br>
            Arkose will also favour the urban area, as with Lille,<br>
            Climb Up also offers rooms on the outskirts.</p>

        <p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion </strong></p><br>

            <p class="paragraphe">The climbing market in France is growing,<br>
                Sustained by a steady increase in the number of practitioners and favourable dynamics,<br>
                The impact of the Olympic Games and the media.<br>
                With more than 2 million climbers, a turnover of 150 million euros<br>
                for venues and 500 million including equipment,<br>
                This sector offers significant opportunities for entrepreneurs.<br> Despite a high concentration of cinemas in some regions such as the Île-de-France<br>
                the Rhône-Alpes region, areas such as the Nord, and more particularly Lille,<br>
                remain underdeveloped.<br>
                This low local competition can be a real opportunity<br>
                to establish themselves in this dynamic market,<br>
                as Climb Up did,<br>
                who has stood out from the competition by offering an experience<br>
                more focused on well-being and the family side,<br>
                and Arkose by offering a more ecological and specialized approach in block.<br>
                These two market leaders seized an opportunity<br>
                and implement different strategies to stand out from the competition.</p>
